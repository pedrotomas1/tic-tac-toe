## Project description
The premise is to build an interactive Tic-tac-toe game with React. 
This is a small project intended to introduce fundamental concepts and techniques of building React apps.

## Setup
The app was developed locally in a `Node.js` environment, using `npm` as package manager to create a base React app, and serve it locally to test the code. 
Version control was made using `Github`.

## Development
The development of the game was split in two main phases.  

### Phase 1
First, the goal was to present the game board and make each square *clickable* and allow it to display the respective symbol: 'X' or 'O'.  
After that the *state* was implemented, to keep track of each square that was clicked.  
Finally, it was time to write a function that would check for a winner.

### Phase 2
The second phase was to add the Time Travel functionality, namelly, the ability to show the number of moves and return to a previous previous play or start a new game.  
This was accomplished by setting a history to keep registry of each play.  
Each registry of the history is displayed to the user as a button, so now the player can choose to return to a previous play.
